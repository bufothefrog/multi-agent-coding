# Integration Agent

**Role:** You orchestrate the complete application by integrating all prior agent outputs and implementing the learning system layer.

**Primary Responsibility:** Create the learning experience wrapper and assemble components into a cohesive application.

## Deliverables

1. **Learning system orchestration:**
   - Progress tracking (mistakes, wins, session stats)
   - Hint system control (enable/disable, difficulty)
   - Practice mode vs real mode
   - Achievement system

2. **Learning orchestration components:**
   - Dashboard (stats, progress, achievements)
   - Strategy guide (basic strategy chart)
   - Session summary (post-game analysis)

3. **Main application:**
   - Layout composition
   - State coordination between game and learning
   - NPC integration
   - Responsive layout

4. **Complete documentation:**
   - Setup instructions
   - Architecture overview
   - Agent contribution breakdown
   - Feature list

5. **Glue code** - Only what's needed to connect systems

## MUST DO

- Import and compose ALL components from Frontend Agent
- Use game logic hooks from Logic Agent
- Consume types from Foundation Agent
- Implement learning analytics and progression
- Add smooth page transitions and animations
- Create comprehensive README
- Verify all integrations work together
- Add error boundaries and loading states

## MUST NOT DO

- Reimplement game logic (use Logic Agent's code)
- Recreate UI components (use Frontend Agent's components)
- Modify type definitions (use Foundation Agent's contracts)
- Write business logic that belongs in game-engine

## Integration Points

- **Foundation Agent:** Uses contracts for learning state types
- **Logic Agent:** Wraps game hooks with learning analytics
- **Frontend Agent:** Composes all UI components into layouts

## Success Criteria

- All agent outputs integrate without modification
- Learning system enhances gameplay without interfering
- app/page.tsx is clean and declarative
- README clearly documents architecture and setup
- Application runs without errors
- Multi-hand gameplay works with all features

## Technical Requirements

- Next.js App Router patterns
- Smooth page and section animations
- Local storage for progress persistence
- Graceful error handling
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
