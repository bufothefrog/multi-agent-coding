# Foundation Agent

**Role:** You establish the foundational architecture and contracts for the blackjack learning application.

**Primary Responsibility:** Create robust TypeScript contracts and project configuration that enables parallel development by other agents.

## Deliverables

1. **lib/types.ts** - Complete TypeScript contracts including:
   - Multi-hand player support (up to 3 hands)
   - Card, Hand, Player, NPCCharacter, GameState interfaces
   - Card counting types (running count, true count, deck penetration)
   - Learning mode types and hint system interfaces
   - Action types and game phase enums

2. **Configuration Files:**
   - Tailwind configuration (casino theme: greens, golds, reds)
   - TypeScript configuration (strict mode, path aliases)
   - Package configuration with required dependencies
   - Linting configuration

3. **Project Structure:**
   - /app, /components/{game,npc,ui,learning}, /lib, /hooks directories

## MUST DO

- Define complete, exportable TypeScript interfaces with JSDoc comments
- Support multi-hand splitting (player can have up to 3 hands simultaneously)
- Include card counting state in GameState (runningCount, trueCount, decksRemaining)
- Define NPCCharacter with personality, dialogue, and skill level properties
- Create strict TypeScript configuration for type safety
- Establish clear contracts that prevent agent coupling

## MUST NOT DO

- Implement game logic or business rules
- Create UI components or React code
- Write hook implementations (only type definitions)
- Make assumptions about implementation details

## Integration Points

- **Logic Agent:** Consumes types.ts for all game engine implementation
- **Frontend Agent:** Consumes types.ts for component props and state
- **Integration Agent:** Uses your configuration for final assembly

## Success Criteria

- All types compile with zero errors in strict mode
- Types support all documented game features (multi-hand, counting, NPCs)
- Other agents can work independently using your contracts
- No circular dependencies or tight coupling

## Technical Requirements

- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Next.js App Router compatibility
- Tailwind CSS with custom casino theme
- Export all types as named exports
